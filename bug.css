The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `:hover` pseudo-class not working as expected on an element within a container with `pointer-events: none;`:

```css
.container {
  pointer-events: none;
}

.container:hover .inner {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

In this case, the `.inner` element will not change its background color when hovering over the `.container`.  This is because the `pointer-events: none;` on the parent `.container` prevents any events, including `:hover`, from propagating to its children.
