The solution involves using a different approach to achieve the hover effect without relying on the `:hover` pseudo-class triggering on the child element.
One approach is to apply the hover effect directly to the parent container and use a different selector to style the inner element.

```css
.container {
  pointer-events: none;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: rgba(255,255,0,0.5); /* Semi-transparent yellow overlay */
}

.container:hover .inner {
  background-color: yellow; 
}

.inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

This solution ensures that the inner element will still be styled when hovering over the parent container, even with `pointer-events: none` in place.
